Basic Document Chunking Demo
Using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

What this demo shows:
This script demonstrates basic document chunking using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter. It takes a sample document and breaks it into smaller, manageable chunks based on character count and separators.

What you'll see:

Original document length and content preview
LangChain text splitter configuration
Document split into multiple chunks (6 chunks total)
Each chunk's length, content, and separator used
Benefits of basic chunking approach
