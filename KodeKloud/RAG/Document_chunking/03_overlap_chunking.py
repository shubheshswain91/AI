Overlap Chunking Demo
Demonstrates the importance of overlap for context preservation

What this demo shows:
This script demonstrates the importance of chunk overlap in RAG systems. It compares chunking with and without overlap, showing how overlap preserves context across chunk boundaries and prevents loss of important information.

What you'll see:

Same document chunked without overlap (7 chunks)
Same document chunked with overlap (7 chunks)
Side-by-side comparison of chunk boundaries
Analysis of context preservation
Clear demonstration of why overlap matters
