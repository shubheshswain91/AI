Chunking Problem Demo
Shows why document chunking is essential for RAG systems

What this demo shows:
This script demonstrates the core problem with searching large documents in RAG systems. It creates a sample employee handbook and shows how searching for specific information (like 'internet speed requirements') returns the entire document instead of just the relevant section.

What you'll see:

A large document stored as a single chunk
Search queries that should find specific sections
Results that return the entire document (the problem!)
Clear explanation of why this is problematic for RAG
